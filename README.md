<h2>TCP for Client Server Modeling</h2>

<p>Networking is a concept of communication between two entities/programms across the network:</p>
<ul>
  <li>client to client</li>
  <li>client to server</li>
  <li>client to itself</li>
</ul>
<p>Where client is an end device usually interfacing with a human. Server on the other hand is a device providing a service for a client</p>

<h3>Client - Server Model</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Server can run constantly and be available for clients to connect to at any time to receive the information clients require.</li>
  <li>Example: web browser as a client conncts Google as a server</li>
</ul>

<h3>Peer-to-Peer model</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Server can run constantly and be available for clients to connect to at any time to receive the information clients require.</li>
  <li>Example: web browser as a client conncts Google as a server</li>
</ul>
